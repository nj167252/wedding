# Laravel Wedding Project



## Wedding Website

Firstly this is an attempt to make a great wedding website. Our wedding will be held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. The website will have a number of pages including:
- The home page
- A breakbown of the bridal party
- The wedding location, with customized Google Map
- A contact page for those who want to contact the wedding planner

I am in the process of learning Laravel and the benefits of git and Github so that is why this is an open source project. I do not expect there to be many contributions other than myself but for those other couples who want a well structured website for free this is for you...
