# Laravel Wedding Project

Firstly this is an attempt to make a great wedding website. Not that it is really important to this repository... our wedding will be held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.

Frontend Pages - or pages none administrators see:
- The home page
- A breakbown of the bridal party
- The wedding location, with customized Google Map
- A contact page for those who want to contact the wedding planner

Backend Pages - pages known to administrators

- Index Events
- Upload Pictures

I am in the process of learning Laravel and the benefits of git and Github so that is why this is an open source project. I do not expect there to be many contributions other than myself but for those other couples who want a well structured website for free this is for you...
